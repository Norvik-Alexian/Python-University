## Python Data Types

Data type is a pair of values and operations. \
<{set of values}, {set of operations}>

Python has rich set of predefined data types, to get type of object we can use `type()` function.

It is better to use embedded data types than create custom ones. If we need to create custom data type, better to build
it extending some predefined types.

Every value in Python is object.

### Basic Embedded Data Types
1. Numbers
2. Strings
3. Lists
4. Dictionaries
5. Tuples
6. Sets
7. Logic Values
8. None
9. Files
10. Program Elements

### Basic Number Types
* Integers: 1, 29, 3
* Floating Point Numbers: 1.9, 2.0
* Complex Numbers: 1+6j, 6+9j
* Fractions
* Decimals
* Booleans

### Object Identity, Data Type, Value
Each object has its identity, value and type, each object representation is called value, identity is created on object 
creation and is identifying object among others, each object has its data type.
