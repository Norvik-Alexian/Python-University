## For Loop

for allows to iterate over elements of array, on each iteration target gets the value of next object element.

## List Comprehension Expression
Comprehension expression consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for
or if clauses. \
`Format: [<expression><for clause><for or if clause>]`

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which
follow it.

To generate new lists based on existing ones we can use comprehension expressions.
