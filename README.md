## Language Introduction
Python is dynamic interpreted (bytecode compiled) language. 
Python support OOP, structured programming and other approaches.
Python trackes the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.

**_Identifier_** in Python is pseudonym for variable, function class, module or some other objects

Python operations can be performed by:
* operators
* specific functions

### Python Data Typing
Python Typing:
* Dynamic Typed (type of variable can change)
* Strongly Typed (value can be associated with one specific type)
* Implicitly Typed (Type of variable shouldn't be declared explicitly)

### Python Indentation
One unusual Python feature is that the whitespace indentation of a piece of code affects its meaning.
According to the official Python style guide you should indent 4 spaces.

### Python Module
Module is the file with Python code and `.py` extension.
Program can call another program after importing them, when we import a module it's being executed.
Import works once for each module, even if it was called several times.

Module is used as library, Module is considered as set of variables names also called namespace.
Each variable name from namespace is called attribute.
Attribute is a variables related to some object like module.

Modular structure with differentiated namespaces allows to avoid name conflicts and makes code more simple dividing
complex construction into smaller chunks.

### Scripts
Script vs Program: script is small and simple program \
Python can be considered for both writing scripts or bigger programs.

### Python Keywords
Keyword is a word that is reserved by a program because the word has a special meaning. Keywords can be command or 
parameters. Every programming language has a set of keywords that cannot be used as a variable names. Keywords sometimes
called reserved names.

### Constants
Constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed and Python doesn't support constant by default.
