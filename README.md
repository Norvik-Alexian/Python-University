## Language Introduction
Python is dynamic interpreted (bytecode compiled) language. 
Python support OOP, structured programming and other approaches.
Python trackes the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.

**_Identifier_** in Python is pseudonym for variable, function class, module or some other objects

Python operations can be performed by:
* operators
* specific functions

### Python Data Typing
Python Typing:
* Dynamic Typed (type of variable can change)
* Strongly Typed (value can be associated with one specific type)
* Implicitly Typed (Type of variable shouldn't be declared explicitly)

### Python Indentation
One unusual Python feature is that the whitespace indentation of a piece of code affects its meaning.
According to the official Python style guide you should indent 4 spaces.
