## Memory Handling in Python
Python interpreter mostly manages the memory, we should not reserve memory, clean memory, etc.

Python deletes unwanted objects (built-in types or class instances) automatically to free the memory space. The process by which Python periodically frees and reclaims blocks of memory that no longer are in use is called `Garbage Collector`.
